# N8N Integration

This integration allows Open WebUI to communicate with workflows created in **n8n**, a powerful workflow automation tool. Messages are sent and received via webhook endpoints, making it easy to plug Open WebUI into your existing automation pipelines.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Recent Improvements (v2.2.0)**: Added AI Agent tool usage display with collapsible details sections. The pipeline now extracts and displays tool calls from `intermediateSteps` in **non-streaming mode**, showing tool names, inputs, and results in a user-friendly format.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Tool Usage Display**: AI Agent tool calls are currently only visible in **non-streaming mode** due to N8N's streaming implementation. The code is future-proof and will automatically work if N8N adds `intermediateSteps` support to streaming responses.

## Features

> [!TIP]
> **AI Agent Tool Usage Display (v2.2.0)** 🛠️
>
> Automatically extracts and displays tool calls from N8N AI Agent workflows in **non-streaming mode**.
>
> - 📊 **Three verbosity levels**: `minimal` (names only), `compact` (names + preview), `detailed` (full info)
> - 📏 **Customizable length limits**: Control input/output text length
> - 🎯 **Flexible configuration**: Adapt display to your needs
>
> Shows tool names, inputs, and results from the `intermediateSteps` array to provide transparency into the AI agent's workflow execution.

- **Streaming & Non-Streaming Support**  
  Automatic detection and handling of both streaming and non-streaming responses with consistent output formatting.

- **Streaming Formats**  
  Streamed replies are parsed line by line: n8n's native streaming (one JSON object per line), Server-Sent Events (`data:` lines; `[DONE]`, `:` comments and `event:`/`id:`/`retry:` fields are dropped) and plain text. JSON objects split across network chunks or written back to back are reassembled, so no SSE framing ends up in the answer (v2.3.1).

- **Token Usage**  
  If the workflow's JSON reply contains an OpenAI-style `usage` object (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`), it is passed to Open WebUI and saved with the message, for streaming and non-streaming chats (fixed in v2.3.1: the answer was saved empty when the chat was streaming).

- **Chat Context**  
  The webhook payload includes `chat_id` and `message_id` of the current Open WebUI chat (empty for API calls that are not part of a chat).

- **SystemPrompt Deduplication**  
  Intelligent removal of duplicate system prompts to prevent redundant instructions.

- **Webhook Communication**  
  Send messages directly to an n8n workflow via a webhook URL.

- **Token-Based Authentication**  
  Secure access to your n8n webhook using a Bearer token or Cloudflare Access tokens.

- **Flexible Input/Output Mapping**  
  Customize which fields in the request/response payload are used for communication.

- **Robust Error Handling**  
  All errors are displayed as user-friendly English messages in the chat interface.

## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables to enable n8n integration:

```bash
# n8n webhook endpoint
# Example: "https://n8n.yourdomain.com/webhook/openwebui-agent"
N8N_URL="https://<your-endpoint>/webhook/<your-webhook>"

# Optional: Bearer token for secure access
N8N_BEARER_TOKEN="your-bearer-token"

# Payload input field (used by Open WebUI to send messages)
INPUT_FIELD="chatInput"

# Payload output field (used by Open WebUI to read the response)
RESPONSE_FIELD="output"

# Optional: Cloudflare Access tokens (if behind Cloudflare Zero Trust)
CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID="your-cloudflare-access-client-id"
CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET="your-cloudflare-access-client-secret"
```

> [!TIP]  
> If your n8n instance is protected behind Cloudflare Zero Trust, you can use service tokens for authentication.
